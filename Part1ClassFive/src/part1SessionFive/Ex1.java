/*Drawbacks of Thread:
 * 1) Bank where money is deposited from one end and withdrawn simenataneously on other
 *  end without even complete full deposit where output will be corrupted so here
 *   we wont use thread concept.
 * 2) 2 people booking only one remaining ticket at the exact same time even here data 
 * will be corrupted, so we don't use thread concept.
 * 3) redeeming of same coupon.
