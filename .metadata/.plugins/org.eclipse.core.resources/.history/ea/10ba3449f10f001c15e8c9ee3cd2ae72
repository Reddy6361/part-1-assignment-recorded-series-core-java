 * String s1 = "pankaj"; //object 1 and stores pankaj in it.
 * String s2 = "pankaj"; // as values are same it will point to object 1 only
 * String s3 = "Pankaj"; // as java is case sensitive this will create new object2 and stores Pankaj.
 * ######################
 * String s1 = new String("pankaj");// creates a new object 1 and stores pankaj.
 * String s2 = "pankaj"; // even though s1 and s2 values are same still as s1 is manually created in new object so here it will create another object 2 and stores pankaj in it.
 * String s3 = "pankaj"; // as values are same it will point to object 2 as here no new object created manually.
 * String s4 =  new String("pankaj"); // creates a new object 3 and stores pankaj.
 * 
 * s1 == s4 -> false 
 * s2 == s1 -> false
