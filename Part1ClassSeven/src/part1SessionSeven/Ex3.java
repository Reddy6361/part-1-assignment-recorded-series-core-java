/*
 * Thread Pool:
 * -------------
 * 1)when you need to limit the number of threads running your application at same time
 * , this will help us to improve the performance of the application,i.e., instead
 *  of starting new thread for every task execute currently task can be passed to
 *  a thread pool.
 * 
 * 2)Thread pool contains collection of thread, as soon as pool has any ideal thread
 *  task is assigned to one then and gets executed.
 * 
 * 3) Thread pool are often used in servers, each connection arriving from network
 *  is wrapped as task and passed to thread pool.
 * 
 * 4)The thread in the thread pool will process the request on the connections done
 *  currently, this is how we can use existing threads instead of creating a new
 *  thread and there by improve the performance in-turns of execution.
